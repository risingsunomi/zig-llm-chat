# zig-llm-chat
A project to create a simple desktop llm chat app in zig. Using this project to learn zig.

## Notes
**Right now this is windows 32 API focused and will add linux next**

Working through using zigwin32 and building out basic windows. Expanding upon that to create a simple chat client then will add LLM APIs.
